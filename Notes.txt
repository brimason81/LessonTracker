TO FIX:


index.php
    - passCheck() - Not working properly **IMROVED 12/14/2020** moved passMatch on top and now works.  
        However, does not match when i change 'pass' to 1234, then change 'passMatch' to 1234; must be done top-down,
        or changes aren't recognized.
        CHECK JavaScript TUTORIAL - WORDS PER MINUTE FUNCTION THAT STARTED WHEN TYPING STARTED COULD BE USED TO START A WHILE LOOP.

    - DB: 'Teachers' TABLE - is there a better way to store days of week?
        + Possibly have 'Schedule' TABLE - 7 column, one for each day of the week; TABLE gets populated via
            TRIGGER when 'studentinfo' or 'teachers' gets changed.
    
    - Add 'Phone' and 'Email' to Teachers TRIGGER?

php function to validate form data? 
    - would be useful on multiple pages, would clean up code, and reduce redundancy

- can't delete from 'studentinfo' table.  Possibly because of Trigger?

-Use Prepared Statements for database input.  May require creating a mysqli object? 
    But will prevent the need for escaping, and therefore will still prevent SQL injection

    - DB
        - Lesson_Tracker:  .sql file upload w/ triggers
        - students:  deleted AFTER DELETE Trigger on Teachers table and studentinfo table - now able to delete Teachers
